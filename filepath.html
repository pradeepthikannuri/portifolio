    inorder to navigate to the right images we have to write the corre ct file path ./ means 
     we can acces the filr which is at the same folder if the file is not at the same folder then we have to write 
     its relative path  where as the relative path means we its like normal file path 
     i.e c:/folder1/img1 and we also have an actual path where we write the shoren form of the relative path where if our file 
     is at folder1->folder2->folder3->img1 if our file path is like this then the relative path will be like ../folder3/img1
     even though we shift the folders folder1,folder2 to some other location still the system will find the file>
